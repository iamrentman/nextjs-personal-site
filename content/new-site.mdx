Here we go! I'm excited to finally be reworking my personal website to better match the skills I've accumulated over the past several years. I've been working a lot with Drupal and most recently with decoupled architectures utilizing Drupal 8 as a back end and Gatsby as the front end. I've really come to enjoy React and the declarative nature of the syntax. The mental model of combining HTML and CSS with Javascript through JSX and CSS-in-JS with React components just makes so much sense.

For this project, I'm exploring Next.js. I'll be posting updates along the way as I work through adapting and expanding this basic setup to suit my needs.

For posterity, ye ol [jrentdesign.com](http://www.jrentdesign.com) lives on...at least until I set up more sections of this site to showcase my design & development work along with some case studies of my favorite projects. Check it out if you're interested, but don't get too picky â€“ the last time I updated it was probably 2013. :grimacing:
