# About me

Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Justin Rent. I live in Keene, NH with my awesome wife, our two wonderful children, and our crazy dog Luna. I spent the first 24 years of my life in Pittsburgh, PA, moved to Atlanta, GA on a whim in 2005, then the whole operation moved up to New England in 2013. I might be biased, but the Northeast is the most beautiful part of our country and I love it more every day.

Since I've fully entered the "adulting" stage of life, much of my time outside of work is spent enjoying life and nature with my family. My Mom says we're a "four seasons family" and that's true. The place we live affords us tremendous opportunities to explore year-round, so we spend most of our time hiking, skiing, biking, swimming, canoeing, paddle boarding, camping, and wandering. In the last couple years I have suddenly become a runner — something I _never_ thought I would enjoy, but I run almost every day now.

I love heavy metal, punk rock, hip-hop, jazz, funk, soul, and rock ‘n roll...and even some country, but only the good stuff.

Some things I believe in include:
+ Black lives matter
+ work/life balance
+ diversity and inclusion
+ open source software
+ preserving our natural environment
