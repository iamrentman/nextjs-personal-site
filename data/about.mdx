# About me

Hello! Thanks for visiting. I'm Justin Rent. I live in Keene, NH with my awesome wife, our two wonderful children, and our crazy dog Luna. I spent the first 24 years of my life in Pittsburgh, PA, moved to Atlanta, GA on a whim in 2005, then moved the whole operation up to New England in 2013. I might be biased, but the Northeast is the most beautiful part of our country and I love it more every day.

My professional career is rooted in graphic design with a constant curiosity for technology and an interest in improving business. As a developer, I've found a sweet spot where I'm well equipped to collaborate closely with strategists and designers to ensure that their work is accurately translated to the browser and results in engaging user experiences. Day-to-day, modern development tools and the development team workflow are where I find myself most engaged.

Since I've fully entered the "adulting" stage of life, much of my time outside of work is spent enjoying life and nature with my family. My Mom says we're a "four seasons family" and that's true. The place we live affords us tremendous opportunities to explore year-round, so we spend most of our time hiking, skiing, biking, swimming, canoeing, paddle boarding, and wandering. In the last couple years I have suddenly become a runner — something I _never_ thought I would enjoy, but I run almost every day now.

I love heavy metal, jazz, funk, soul, rock ‘n roll, hip-hop,

Some things I believe in include:
+ Black lives matter
+ work/life balance
+ diversity and inclusion
+ open source software
+ preserving our natural environment
